Dear Sir or Madam,\\[1.5em]
%
I am an undergraduate in my final year of BEng(hons) Software Engineering at Edinburgh Napier University looking for graduate opportunities as my first step to what I am driving to be a successful and exciting career. I have a particular interest in embedded systems, IoT, and software in transport and machines like those in the automotive and aerospace industries. As a leader in that field I believe your company can be a valuable entryway and potentially occupy the next few rungs on my ladder.

During my course and in a summer placement completed between 3rd and 4th year I have been developing my programming skills and knowledge of computer systems. I have received recognitions of merit from the university for my success in 1st and 3rd year and am on my way to achieve a a 1st class overall. So far I have acquired a sound understanding of Java, C\#, C++ and Python, which I particularly admire for its simplicity and readability. Along with this I have spent time using various micro-controller platforms utilising multiple sensors and output devices.

However, I recognise that superior technical skills do not necessarily make a person a valued contributor. Prior to university, I gained high-level qualifications in mountain bike guiding and bike mechanics which give me both a people perspective and a practical approach to problem solving. I also attempted  to launch and manage a business to manufacture and sell an electronic device of my own design but had to finish due to time constraints and market competition. During my summer 2016 internship I saw development practices in use and became a valuable member of the team by managing performance tests and aiding developers with debugging performance problems.

Due to my decision to leave education early return at a later date, I lack qualifications you may see from higher education, such as A-level or adv. higher maths. To counteract this I have sought out and produced projects which are mathematically challenging and in some cases involve intermediate physics. These projects include the production of a wearable crash sensor which uses three dimensional trigonometry to calculate the wearer's orientation, a data logging device utilising data analysis to calculate adjustments for mountain bike suspension, and the use of image analysis for a similar purpose. The latter being my honours project and still in progress.

Thank you for taking the time to review my application and I look forward to discussing how I can be of value to your company in the coming weeks.
