Dear Sir or Madam,\\[1.5em]
%

I am a mature student currently on track to achieve a first class honours degree in software engineering from Edinburgh Napier University looking for a graduate opportunity as my first step of what I intend to make a successful and exciting career. My interests are in embedded systems, IoT, and the application of software in the automotive and aerospace industries. As a leader in this field, I believe you can make use of my current skills and provide me with a progressive career path.

Both during my course and in a summer placement I have been developing my programming skills and knowledge of computer systems. So far I have acquired a sound understanding of Java, C\#, C++ and Python, which I particularly admire for its simplicity and readability. Along with this I have spent time using various micro-controller platforms utilising multiple sensors and output devices.

However, I recognise that superior technical skills do not necessarily make a person a valued contributor. Prior to university, I gained high-level qualifications in mountain bike guiding and bike mechanics which give me both a people perspective and a practical approach to problem solving. I also investigated commercializing the device and application that I developed as part of my third year project, eventually putting it aside due to lack of time and funding. During my summer 2016 internship with a global EDA and system design company, I experienced using development practices in the workplace and became a valuable member of the team by managing performance tests and helping developers to debug performance issues.

Because I lack qualifications, such as A-level or Higher mathematics I have immersed myself in projects that are mathematically challenging and in some cases involve intermediate physics. These projects include the development and production of a wearable crash sensor which uses three-dimensional trigonometry to calculate the wearer's orientation, a data logging device that uses complex analysis to calculate adjustments to improve mountain bike suspension performance, and finally the use of image analysis for a similar purpose.

Thank you for taking the time to review my application. I trust you will give me the opportunity to meet and discuss how I can contribute to the continuing success of your company.

Yours sincerely,\\[2em]
