###### What do you see as your own strengths and weaknesses? What have you done to build on your strengths and develop areas of weakness?
One strength of mine is a strong attention to detail. I can easily identify details in my work or life which, though small, when addressed or carried out correctly can make a large overall difference. For example when I write code for a piece of software I take the time to ensure each algorithm or statement is as clean and efficient as possible. This leads to more readable source code and sometimes efficient solutions to problems.

A further strengh is my ability to communicate my ideas clearly. When discussing 

A weakness of mine is my lack of mathematical qualifications such as A-levels or Highers. This is due to my decision to enter employment immediately after leaving high school and take a career path relating to my hobby of mountain biking. To counteract this I have undertaken projects at university which are mathematically demanding or involve intermediate physics such as the development of a wearable crash sensor involving three dimensional trigonometry.
